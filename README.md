# pyChat
A simple python console chat

## HOW TO

1. start server.py (don't worry about what is written on it)
2. start client.py for each client you want


NOTE: If you are using different computers ( I hope ! ):
start client.py from console like this:
python client.py 'addr'

and replace 'addr' with the server's computer address

Hope this is clear... Tell me of any mistakes or for clarifications
